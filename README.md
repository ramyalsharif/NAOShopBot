# NAOShopBot

The primary service provided by artificial Intelligence is human assistance to perform complex and simple tasks. This project is an example of a simple task made convenient by simple AI.

By conversation (speech recognition and a logical flow of binary decision making), this agent (designed to run on a NAO Robot) assists a human with the simple task of creating a shopping list. After constructing and verifying the listsâ€™ correctness, the agent offers the user to send this list by email such that the human may review this list at a later time.
